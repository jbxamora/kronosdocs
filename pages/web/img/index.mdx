# Cloudinary Phototographer Portfolio

This template is a professional and customizable image gallery portfolio site built using Next.js, Cloudinary, and Tailwind.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the template on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:  

`git clone https://github.com/jbxamora/photoport.git` . 
  
2. Install Dependencies:  
  
`npm i` **or** `npm install`
  
3. Create a dotenv file with the following lines, and replace `yourcloudinarycloudname`, `yourcloudinaryapikey`, and `yourcloudinaryapisecret` with your Cloudinary account details:
  
```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=yourcloudinarycloudname
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=yourcloudinaryapikey
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=yourcloudinaryapisecret
```
  
4. Run the application on your local machine:
  
`npm run dev`

This will ensure the app runs with your Cloudinary account settings. Please follow the steps below to customize the template further.
## Cloudinary Setup 

To connect your own folders and images, you need to make the following adjustments in the code:

1. Update the folder paths:

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const results = await cloudinary.v2.search
    .expression(`folder:samples/*`) // select folder that holds ALL images
    .sort_by("public_id", "desc")
    .max_results(400)
    .execute();
  let reducedResults: ImageProps[] = [];

  let i = 0;
  for (let result of results.resources) {
    reducedResults.push({
      id: i,
      height: result.height,
      width: result.width,
      public_id: result.public_id,
      format: result.format,
    });
    i++;
  }

```

 
```js

  const fetchImagesByCategory = async (category: string) => {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(
        `/api/images?folder=samples/${encodeURIComponent(category)}` // Do the same here.
      );
```  

2. Adjust the categories in the Filter component. Please note that the folder names are case-sensitive:

```js
<Filter
          categories={[
            "animals",
            "Lifestyle",
            "people",
            "Events",
            "landscapes",
          ]}
          onCategorySelect={handleCategorySelect}
        />
```

## What I Learned

In the development of this project, I gained valuable insights and expertise in the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: Next.js was instrumental in creating a seamless user interface that delivers an optimal experience across a wide range of devices. Its support for both client-side and server-side data fetching ensured the rapid and efficient loading of images.

- **Cloudinary**: Cloudinary played a key role in storing, optimizing, and delivering images for the portfolio. By leveraging Cloudinary's API, I could easily fetch images and utilize its powerful manipulation features to ensure optimal display size and format.

- **TailwindCSS**: TailwindCSS was utilized to design a modern and responsive user interface. Its utility-first approach made it straightforward to customize the portfolio's design and achieve a unique look and feel.

- **Imagemin**: Imagemin, a module for image minification, was employed to compress images before uploading them to Cloudinary. This step significantly reduced image file sizes without sacrificing quality, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the site.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript was chosen to enhance type safety and improve tooling in the project. Its static typing system made the codebase more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.
