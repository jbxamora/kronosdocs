## What I Learned

Through the development and deployment of PromptPal, valuable insights and expertise were gained in several key areas:

- **React & Next.js**: The use of React in conjunction with Next.js facilitated the creation of a dynamic, responsive user interface, as well as the implementation of server-side rendering.

- **Google OAuth**: Implementing Google's OAuth 2.0 system for user authentication provided experience in managing secure and streamlined login processes.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, provided a deeper understanding of modern web design practices and the creation of highly customizable, responsive designs.

- **Bcrypt**: Implementing Bcrypt for password hashing and salting enhanced knowledge in the area of web security and data protection.

- **Deployment with Vercel**: The experience of deploying a Next.js app using the Vercel Platform added practical understanding of application deployment and continuous integration processes. More details on deployment can be found in the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
